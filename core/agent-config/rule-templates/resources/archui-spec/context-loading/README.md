# Module Context Loading

## Rule

When reading any module's identity document (`README.md`, `SPEC.md`, `SKILL.md`, `HARNESS.md`, `MEMORY.md`), you **must also read** `.archui/index.yaml` in the same directory. A module's context is not complete until both files have been read.

## Why

Identity documents contain only `name` and `description`. The structural half of a module — its `uuid`, `submodules` (child modules), and `links` (cross-module dependencies) — lives exclusively in `.archui/index.yaml`. Skipping it means you are missing:

- **uuid** — needed to identify this module in links from other modules
- **submodules** — the list of child modules this module contains
- **links** — what other modules this module depends on, implements, or extends

## When this applies

Every time you read a module to understand it, modify it, or reason about its relationships. There are no exceptions.

## Common violations

- Reading `SPEC.md` and starting to edit without checking what the module links to
- Answering "what does this module depend on?" from the identity document body alone
- Creating a new link without first reading `index.yaml` to check existing links
