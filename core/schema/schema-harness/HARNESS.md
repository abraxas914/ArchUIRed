name: Schema Test Playbook
description: "Playbook for verifying that identity document (README.md, SPEC.md, HARNESS.md, MEMORY.md, SKILL.md) frontmatter is correctly parsed, validated for required and optional fields, and that the description field is properly treated as agent-facing context."
---

## Overview

This playbook verifies that the YAML frontmatter schema shared by all identity document types is correctly parsed and validated, including required field presence, optional field handling, and body parsing behavior.

## Playbook

### Group 1: Required fields enforcement

[init] A valid ArchUI project root exists with `.archui/index.yaml` and a passing root identity document. A module `schema-test/` is present with all five frontmatter fields populated.

[action] Remove the `uuid` field from the `schema-test/` identity document frontmatter.
[eval] `archui validate` reports a missing required field error for `schema-test/`: `uuid` is absent.

[action] Restore `uuid`. Remove the `name` field.
[eval] `archui validate` reports a missing required field error for `schema-test/`: `name` is absent.

[action] Restore `name`. Remove the `description` field.
[eval] `archui validate` reports a missing required field error for `schema-test/`: `description` is absent.

[action] Restore `description`. Confirm all three required fields are present.
[eval] `archui validate` reports no errors for `schema-test/`.

[end] Remove `schema-test/` and its entry from `.archui/index.yaml`. Confirm `archui validate` passes.

---

### Group 2: Optional fields omission

[init] A valid ArchUI project root exists and passes validation. A module `minimal-module/` is present with only the three required fields (`uuid`, `name`, `description`) and no `submodules` or `links` fields.

[action] Run `archui validate` against the project.
[eval] `archui validate` passes with no errors. Omitting `submodules` and `links` is valid when no submodules or links exist.

[action] Add an explicit `submodules: []` to the `minimal-module/` identity document.
[eval] `archui validate` still passes. An empty list is equivalent to omitting the field.

[action] Add an explicit `links: []` to the `minimal-module/` identity document.
[eval] `archui validate` still passes. An empty links list is equivalent to omitting the field.

[action] Add an unrecognized field `custom-field: some-value` to the `minimal-module/` identity document frontmatter.
[eval] `archui validate` passes. Unrecognized frontmatter fields are ignored (forward-compatibility).

[end] Remove `minimal-module/` and its entry from `.archui/index.yaml`. Confirm `archui validate` passes.

---

### Group 3: Frontmatter position and delimiter rules

[init] A valid ArchUI project root exists and passes validation. A module `delimiter-test/` is present with valid frontmatter beginning on line 1 of its identity document.

[action] Add a blank line before the opening `---` delimiter of the `delimiter-test/` identity document, so the frontmatter no longer starts on line 1.
[eval] `archui validate` reports a frontmatter parse error on `delimiter-test/`: the frontmatter block must begin on line 1 of the file.

[action] Remove the leading blank line so frontmatter begins on line 1 again. Remove the closing `---` delimiter.
[eval] `archui validate` reports a frontmatter parse error on `delimiter-test/`: the closing `---` delimiter is missing.

[action] Restore the closing `---` delimiter.
[eval] `archui validate` passes for `delimiter-test/`.

[end] Remove `delimiter-test/` and its entry from `.archui/index.yaml`. Confirm `archui validate` passes.

---

### Group 4: Description field semantics

[init] A valid ArchUI project root exists and passes validation. A module `desc-test/` is present with a `description` value that is a single sentence ending with a period.

[action] Load the agent context for the project (simulate what an LLM agent would receive — descriptions of all modules without opening full files).
[eval] The description of `desc-test/` appears in the agent context as a single sentence, exactly as written in the frontmatter. The Markdown body of the identity document is not included.

[action] Replace the `description` value in the `desc-test/` identity document with a multi-paragraph string spanning multiple lines.
[eval] `archui validate` reports a warning or error that the `description` field must be a single sentence. The field must be self-contained and not rely on the body for context.

[action] Restore `description` to a single, accurate, declarative sentence.
[eval] `archui validate` passes for `desc-test/`.

[end] Remove `desc-test/` and its entry from `.archui/index.yaml`. Confirm `archui validate` passes.
